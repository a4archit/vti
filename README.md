# VTI (Video To Images)
Current version: Beta version


### Problem:    

When an AI-ML beginner aspirant needs somewhat to make easy its data collection regarding images for CNN model than that programmer spend its maximum time to collect well labeled data for his project.

            

### Solution:   

By the usage of my current knowledge I made a small and basic tool that helps to fetch a lot (hundreds or thousands) of images in few seconds or minutes from live camera or the recoded videos. I named this tool VTI (Video To Images), that's easy to use (user friendly) and this tool is open-source.


            

### Technologies used in this tool:

  - Python
  - Computer Vision (opencv-python)
  - Numeric Python (Numpy)
  - Tkinter [for GUI]
  - MTCNN [for human face detection]
  - other modules (os, datetime, webbrowser)
