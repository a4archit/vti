When an AI-ML beginner aspirant needs somewhat to make easy its data collection regarding images for CNN model than that programmer spend its maximum time to collect well labeled data for his project.

### Technologies used in this tool:

  - Tkinter [for GUI]
  - MTCNN [for human face detection]
  - other modules (os, datetime, webbrowser)
